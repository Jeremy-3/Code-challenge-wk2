# Interactive Shopping List
## Objective:
Develop a webpage with a shopping list. Users can add items to the list, mark items as purchased, and clear the list.

## Requirements:
Array: Maintain a JavaScript array to store shopping list items.

## DOM Manipulation:
- Create an HTML structure with an input field for adding items, a list container to display items, and buttons for "Add", "Mark Purchased", and "Clear List".
 
- Use JavaScript to dynamically add new items to the list container when the user clicks the "Add" button. **\(The new items do not have to be persisted once the page refreshes)**

- Update the list item visually to indicate purchased items **\(e.g., strikethrough text, different background color)**.

## Event Handling:
- Attach event listeners to the "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list. 

- Attach event listeners to the list of items to allow users to mark them as purchased.

- Attach an event listener to the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.

## Running Application
- Open the index.html file in Mozilla Firefox, Safari or any Chromium-based browser.

- If using VS Code, you can use the Live Server extension to run the file on the browser for live reloading.

- Click [HERE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to install the Live Server extension and to read instructions on how to use it.

- Remember to input your items and click on the add button so as to add item onto the list

- Lets not forget to mark our items as purchased so as to differentiate them from the non purchased goods 

- Last but not least do not forget to clear the list when not in use.
